# 1. General Notes

> You are generally supposed to keep the HTML structure relatively the same, with only changing the styles in the different CSS files scattered around the project and the text to be related to the new theme and event.

> If you'd like to add functionality, you can do so using the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), adding TypeScript files, etc.

## Quick Start a New Event

1. Edit `app/metadata.tsx` and provide event data — ticket window dates, event date, pricing, contact numbers, early bird deadline, year, etc.
2. Edit `app/payment-methods.tsx` to update payment receiver contacts (Telda username, InstaPay number, VF Cash number, card redirect links, etc.). Payment methods have a structured schema: `displayName`, `identifier`, `to`, `instructions`, `field`, `icon`, and optional `redirectLinks` and `hidden` flag.
3. In the admin dashboard, there will be a shield ✕ button when the event is concluded. Press it to reset the data (after downloading if you would like to keep it for next year's marketing).
4. Create a Design on Figma (for the non-admin areas) with the team that relates to the theme and is aesthetically appealing.
5. After creating a compelling design, update the CSS files found in `app/styles/` and `app/book/` without changing the class names to avoid errors. For adding elements, make sure you correctly set their `className` field to `styles.{yourNewClassName}`.
6. Have fun!!

# 3. Architecture Overview

## Central Configuration (`app/metadata.tsx`)

All event-specific configuration is centralized here:

- **Pricing**: `INDIVIDUAL_TICKET_PRICE`, `GROUP_TICKET_PRICE`, `TEACHER_TICKET_PRICE`, `DISCOUNTED_TICKET_PRICE`, `INDIVIDUAL_EARLY_PRICE`, `GROUP_EARLY_PRICE`
- **Dates**: `TICKET_WINDOW` (booking open/close), `EARLY_BIRD_UNTIL`, `EVENT_DATE`
- **Contact**: `PHONE`, `VFCASH`, `TELDA`, `IPN`
- **Other**: `YEAR`, `HOST`, `EVENT_DESC`, `SPEAKER_FREE_TICKETS`, `support`, `paymentProcessor`

## Ticket Types (`app/ticket-types.tsx`)

Eight ticket types are supported:

| Type                   | Enum Value              | Notes                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual             | `individual`            | Standard single ticket                                    |
| Group                  | `group`                 | 4-person group, linked via `groups` table                 |
| Speaker                | `speaker`               | Free, admin-generated invitations                         |
| Giveaway               | `giveaway`              | Free promotional tickets, generated through the dashboard |
| Discounted (Rush Hour) | `discounted`            | Marketing rush hour codes                                 |
| Teacher                | `teacher`               | Fixed price for teachers                                  |
| Individual Early Bird  | `individual_early_bird` | Early bird pricing                                        |
| Group Early Bird       | `group_early_bird`      | Early bird group pricing                                  |

## Payment Methods (`app/payment-methods.tsx`)

Five payment methods with structured definitions:

| Key      | Display Name         | Notes                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TLDA`   | Telda                | Requires Telda username                                        |
| `IPN`    | InstaPay             | Requires InstaPay address (IPA)                                |
| `VFCASH` | eWallet              | Requires phone number                                          |
| `CASH`   | School Office (Cash) | No additional field                                            |
| `CARD`   | Credit/Debit Card    | Redirects to Bedayia's Custom Portal (or PayMob in the future) |

Payment method strings are stored as `METHOD@identifier` (e.g., `TLDA@username`, `CASH@email@domain.com`, `CARD@orderId`).

## Price Calculation (`app/api/tickets/prices.tsx`)

The `getPrice(type, receivedAt, method)` function calculates the correct price considering:

- Ticket type
- Early bird deadline (if `receivedAt < EARLY_BIRD_UNTIL`)
- Speaker and giveaway tickets are always free (return `0`)

## Database Tables

| Table        | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attendees`  | Main ticket records (email, name, phone, type, payment_method, paid, uuid, sent, admitted_at, admitted_by, created_at) |
| `groups`     | Links 4 attendees (id1–id4) for group tickets                                                                          |
| `pay_backup` | Payment audit log (stream, incurred, received, received_at)                                                            |
| `rush_hour`  | Marketing rush hour codes (code, attendee_id, processed)                                                               |

---

# 4. eTicket System

## 4.1 Booking a Ticket

1. Attendees fill in their name, email address, phone number, and choose a payment method.
2. **For cash**: An email is sent guiding them to pay at the school office with their Attendee ID.
3. **For Telda/InstaPay/eWallet**: The attendee provides their payment identifier. They are instructed to send the payment and a screenshot to the WhatsApp number.
4. **For card**: The attendee is redirected to Paymob's unified checkout. Payment is processed automatically via webhook callback.
5. **For rush hour codes**: If a valid code is provided and already processed, an eTicket is immediately sent. Otherwise, the ticket waits for payment confirmation.

## 4.2 Accepting Payments

1. **School Office** has a portal to accept cash payments by entering an attendee's email and the amount received.
2. **Payment handlers** (admins or assigned users with specific payment method access) accept payments from their dashboard. They search by the sender's username/identifier. If multiple unpaid tickets match, the system returns an ambiguity response (HTTP 431) with a list of candidates for the admin to choose from.
3. Upon successful payment acceptance, the system generates a unique UUID, assigns it to the ticket, records the payment in `pay_backup`, and sends an eTicket email with a QR code.
4. **Card payments** are processed automatically via Paymob webhook — no manual acceptance needed.

## 4.3 Admitting into the Event

1. People come in with their unique QR codes in print or on phone.
2. Gate Ushers have access to a separate **Ushers App** (PWA) that scans QR codes and calls the admit API with an `APP_KEY`.
3. The system supports both **full UUID** (36 chars) and **partial UUID** (minimum 8 chars, prefix match) for admission.
4. If the QR code has been already used, isn't paid for, or doesn't exist, the usher receives an error message. The head usher has access to the full admin dashboard for manual investigation.
5. On success, the attendee's name is shown and the usher admits them.
6. **Row-level locking** (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) prevents race conditions from concurrent scans.
7. A **2.5-second grace window** allows the same device to re-scan without triggering a duplicate admission error (prevents iPhone double-scan glitches).
8. The API enforces a **36-hour time window** around the event date — admission is only possible within 36 hours of the event.

### Routes

| Route                        | Method | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/tickets/admit/{uuid}/` | `GET`  | Admit an attendee (params: `key`, `device`) |

> **Security**: This API can only admit — it cannot de-admit, since ushers shouldn't have that authority.

---

## 4.4 On-Door Ticket Sales

Walk-in attendees can be registered and immediately admitted during the event. This is used by ushers via the Ushers App.

1. **GET**: Returns current ticket price and available payment methods (filtered to exclude CASH, CARD, and VFCASH from the list).
2. **POST**: Creates a new attendee record that is immediately marked as **paid**, **sent**, and **admitted**. Records the payment in `pay_backup`. Uses database transactions for atomicity.
3. The endpoint is only available within a **36-hour window** around the event date.
4. CORS headers are set for the Ushers App.

### Routes

| Route                   | Method | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/tickets/on-door/` | `GET`  | Get ticket price and payment methods                                                                                       |
| `/api/tickets/on-door/` | `POST` | Register and admit a walk-in attendee (body: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `key`, `device`, `paymentMethod`, `senderUsername`) |

# 7. Email System

The system uses a **dual-provider email architecture**:

### Primary: Resend

- Uses React Email components (`app/components/TicketEmail.tsx`) for eTickets
- Rate-limited at 600ms between sends (~1.67 req/s, safely under Resend's 2 req/s limit)
- Inline QR code attachments via CID for Gmail client compatibility
- Background sending via Vercel's `after()` API (fluid compute)
- Webhook listener at `/api/webhooks/resend/` to handle bounced/failed emails (marks `sent = false`)

### Fallback: Gmail (Nodemailer + OAuth2)

- Automatically used if any Resend emails fail
- Uses HTML templates from `public/` directory
- Uses Gmail OAuth2 authentication (no "less secure apps" needed)

### Booking Confirmations

- Sent via Gmail (Nodemailer) for cash payment tickets, done to save on Resend usage
- Uses `public/booked.html` template
- Handled by `app/api/utils/email-helper.tsx`

### Email Templates

| File                             | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/components/TicketEmail.tsx` | React Email eTicket component (primary, used with Resend) |
| `public/booked.html`             | Booking confirmation email                                |
| `public/eTicket-template.html`   | Gmail fallback eTicket template                           |
| `public/speaker-eticket.html`    | Speaker invitation eTicket template                       |

# 8. Security

### CSRF Protection (`app/api/utils/csrf.tsx`)

- **Strict mode** (`validateCsrf`): Requires valid `Origin` or `Referer` header matching allowed origins. Used on admin endpoints.
- **Lenient mode** (`validateCsrfLenient`): Allows requests without headers (for mobile app compatibility). Used on public-facing booking endpoints.
- Allowed origins: production hostname + www variant, Vercel preview URL, localhost (dev only), plus any `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env variable.

### Authentication

- JWT tokens with 7-day expiry stored in cookies
- Role-based access control with method-scoped permissions
- Marketing member passwords generated via HMAC-SHA256 deterministic hashing

### Input Sanitization (`app/api/utils/input-sanitization.tsx`)

- Email format validation and common misspelling auto-correction (e.g., `@gamil` → `@gmail`, `@bedaya` → `@bedayia`, `.xom` → `.com`)
- Payment method validation with method-specific rules (Telda: alphanumeric, InstaPay: alphanumeric + `.` `-` `_`, eWallet: phone format)
- Name safety check (alphanumeric + Arabic characters + symbols)
- Phone number validation (minimum 10 digits)

### Database Security

- Row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) on admission and payment processing to prevent race conditions
- Database transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) for atomicity
- Parameterized SQL queries throughout

### Payment Security

- Paymob HMAC SHA-512 verification on webhook callbacks
- APP_KEY validation on usher endpoints
- 36-hour event time window enforcement on admission and on-door endpoints

---

# 9. Things to Maintain

- **Domain Name**: [tedxbedayia.com](https://tedxbedayia.com) — renew around 31st of December.
- **Vercel Hosting**: Ensure everything is linked to the GitHub repository and domain.
- **Database**: Clear after last year's event and after testing.
- **Resend Account**: Ensure the API key and webhook secret are configured.
- **Gmail Account**: OAuth2 credentials must be valid (used as email fallback + booking confirmations + speaker invitations).
- **Paymob Account**: Keep API keys, HMAC secret, and integration IDs updated for card payments.

# Appendix: Ushers App

The Ushers App is a separate **PWA** project at `AlyMobarak/PWA` — request access from the author if needed. It communicates with:

- `GET /api/tickets/admit/{uuid}/` — scan and admit attendees
- `GET /api/tickets/on-door/` — fetch pricing and payment methods
- `POST /api/tickets/on-door/` — register walk-in attendees
